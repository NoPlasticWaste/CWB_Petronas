      "Dear Esteemed Partners,\n",
      "It gives me pleasure to introduce the 2023 - 2025 edition of the PETRONAS Activity Outlook.\n",
      "The global economic activity is experiencing a broad-based and sharper-than-expected slowdown \n",
      "as well as the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",
      "The resultant labour shortages, record-high commodity prices and global supply chain disruptions \n",
      "will all weigh heavily on the outlook. Cost-of-living crisis caused by persistent inflationary pressures \n",
      "and tightening financial conditions can already be seen globally.\n",
      "As we face the ongoing market uncertainties combined with the complexity of the energy \n",
      "transition, industries today are compelled to depart from business-as-usual. We need to actively \n",
      "shape the direction of the industry, anticipate market requirements and find solutions to meet \n",
      "these demands. Responding with agile strategies and willingness to embrace innovation as well as \n",
      "new solutions to face the new normal, is important in facing the rapid changes.\n",
      "06 05The new energy transition and landscape calls for greater collaborations not only among industry \n",
      "players but also among other industries towards creating efficient solutions for better cost \n",
      "management, heightened customer centricity, value-creation and innovative solutions. We must \n",
      "tap the full potential of technologies at our disposal and develop innovative technologies to offer \n",
      "the solutions needed to meet the world’s growing demand for energy. This mindset is crucial as \n",
      "the industry is faced with greater demands for sustainable environmental products. \n",
      "The industry players must push on with innovation while remaining cost competitive at par with \n",
      "global players in the course of doing business to ensure projects and production remain feasible \n",
      "despite the cyclical swings in oil price. PETRONAS is committed to working together with our \n",
      "partners as the industry accelerates its efforts to decarbonise operations as part of a wider\n",
      "energy transition.\n",
      "The transition into clean energy needs to happen now, to meet the changing energy landscape \n",
      "projected by 2050. This is crucial to avoid missing the window of opportunity to navigate the \n",
      "energy transition successfully.\n",
      "As we continue to build our strength and resilience through the current challenges and beyond, we \n",
      "must now navigate the immediate future with explicit understanding that sustainability is our new \n",
      "license to operate. Therefore, in our duty as stakeholders of the energy ecosystem, it is imperative \n",
      "that we navigate these challenges with a deep-rooted purpose. \n",
      "The responsibility to shift towards a lower-carbon future shall not fall on the shoulders of one party \n",
      "but must be carried through by the whole ecosystem. What we are setting out to achieve, can be \n",
      "achieved if we work together. \n",
      "We must collaborate as an effective engine that provides energy that is clean, reliable and \n",
      "affordable as well as co-create an ecosystem that is resilient to enable a just transition. \n",

      "Two years have passed since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global \n",
      "pandemic, the resultant impact of which suppressed oil and gas demand across the world. Even as \n",
      "recovery began to set in at the start of 2022, the world faced an energy crisis that was ampliﬁed by \n",
      "the geopolitical turmoil in Europe as supply failed to catch up to the energy demand rebound due \n",
      "to prolonged supply chain disruptions. \n",
      "Despite the challenges and upheaval, the ﬁght against climate change has become more urgent \n",
      "with more countries, organisations and environmentalists stepping up the call to action. The United \n",
      "Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 in Egypt ended with an agreement for the creation of \n",
      "a loss-and-damage fund for countries hit hard by climate disasters. This illustrates the growing \n",
      "scrutiny on industry players’ moves in delivering their respective commitments to limit emissions \n",
      "and increase in global temperature.  \n",
      "This comes at a time when costs are rising as commodity prices escalate. The combination of \n",
      "broadening inﬂationary pressures, labour shortages and supply chain disruptions in addition to the \n",
      "newfound challenges such as climate change, is set to reshape the energy landscape. \n",
      "In the near term, these challenges might pose a growing risk of global recession, threatening to \n",
      "derail a recovery in oil and gas demand. Geopolitical upheavals add to the challenges of ensuring \n",
      "uninterrupted ﬂows in energy and other commodities.  \n",
      "The uncertainties have yet to recede and recovery remains uneven across the world. The current \n",
      "elevated oil and gas prices are not an assurance of high prices in the future. The industry remains \n",
      "cautious over rising costs, which erode margins for players. Yet, the sector has to build its resilience \n",
      "today by deploying the latest technology and utilising resources in an optimal manner to weather \n",
